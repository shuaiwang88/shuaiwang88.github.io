## The open source tools I use on daily basis:
* Manjaro Distro ([I use Arch btw](https://www.redbubble.com/people/rodebubbel/works/31716594-i-use-arch?p=sticker))
* NeoVim (story [1](https://bit.ly/2MQSAh3))
* Spacemacs
* Org-mode
* zsh
* i3wm
* Tmux

## For R, Python, and Julia programming I use:
[Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) for R and
[vimcmdline](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline) for python and julia.
They are lightweight yet powerful IDE to write and run code inside neovim
environment.  

## For math modeling I use:
[Minizinc](https://github.com/MiniZinc) and [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) to model
optimization problem, and [COINOR-CBC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) as
default open-source solver, [Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) in commercial/academic setting.


## My speak:
1. [A Gentle Introduction to Modern Optimization Tools in R](https://github.com/shuaiwang88/intro_optimization_CinDay_R_meetup_May_22_2019/blob/master/Gental_Intro_Optimization_R.pdf)
at Cincinnati and R meetup on May 22 2019

2. [Data Mining and Mathematical Models for Optimal Scholarship Allocation for a State University](https://github.com/shuaiwang88/dissertation/blob/master/Seminar_Presentation.pdf)
at [WSU Engineering seminar](https://josephcslater.github.io/josephcslater/classes/speakers/Wang.html) on Dec 2016.

## My blog post:
1. [Construction Speed in Popular Open Source Math Modeling Tools: minizinc vs
   pyomo vs JuMP](https://bit.ly/30Np80u) featured in [Julia Computing newsletter](https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2019/10/03/october-newsletter.html).  


## The tech I like and dislike:
### Like:
* Julia Language: the only nice-looking language capable in both prototyping and production.

* Minizinc: I once converted an optimization model in production with **1200** lines written in R to **28** lines in Minizinc.

### Dislike:
* Sql: I never like this and my brain will stop working when joining more than 2 tables.

* Windows: I do own a laptop running Windows 10 at work, and my wallpaper is logo of windows 95.
