          My research is in the areas of optimization and machine learning, with applications in Retail, Higher Education, and Public Policy.
          
          My current focus is to apply optimization and machine learning algorithms to real world problems involving large datasets. 
          <p>
          I had the pleasure to partner with <a href="https://www.wright.edu/">Wright State Univeristy</a> to optimize their <a href="https://www.wright.edu/raiderconnect/financial-aid/first-year-scholarships">First-Year Scholarships</a>; <a href "https://www.kroger.com/">Kroger</a> with their promotion planning, staff scheduling, routing, and inventory control projects. One of work I participated was selected as an  <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2013/01/31/wsu-professor-who-saved-kroger.html">Edelman award finalist </a>; and  <a href "http://happydogsnyc.com/">HappyDogsNYC</a> to optimize their weekly staff scheduling (open source) as pro bono work. 
          <p>
          
          <p>
          With utmost pleasure, I am selected to help the <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/cityofcincinnati/" > 
          City of Cincinnati </a> to redesign their public school bus routing and bell time using optimization modeling.
