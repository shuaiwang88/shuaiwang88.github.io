          My research is in the areas of optimization and machine learning, with applications in Retail, Higher Education, and Public Policy.
          
          My current focus is to apply optimization and machine learning algorithms to real world problems involving large datasets. 
          <p>
          I had the pleasure to partner with <a href="https://www.wright.edu/">Wright State Univeristy</a> to optimize their <a href="https://www.wright.edu/raiderconnect/financial-aid/first-year-scholarships">First-Year Scholarships</a>; <a href "https://www.kroger.com/">Kroger</a> with their promotion planning, staff scheduling, routing, and inventory control projects. One of work I participated was selected as an  <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2013/01/31/wsu-professor-who-saved-kroger.html">Edelman award finalist </a>; and  <a href "http://happydogsnyc.com/">HappyDogsNYC</a> to optimize their weekly staff scheduling (open source) as pro bono work. 
          <p>
          
          <p>
          With utmost pleasure, I am selected to help the <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/cityofcincinnati/" > 
          City of Cincinnati </a> to redesign their public school bus routing and bell time using optimization modeling.

          <li>My research papers are listed <a href="https://sebmart.github.io/research.html">here</a>.</li>
          <li>In September 2018, I <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">collaborated</a> with the Boston Globe and Boston Public Schools to study the impact of changing the start times in Boston, with a potential for $18M in yearly savings for the district, better student health and equity.</li>
          <li>In Spring 2017, I won the $30K <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge">Boston Public Schools Transportation Challenge</a> together with <a href="https://adelarue.github.io/">Arthur Delarue</a> and Dimitris Bertsimas. 
          Our bus routing algorithm is now implemented and <b>we are routing tens of thousands of students to school every day</b>. It saves $5M dollars every year, reallocated to better serve the children of Boston.</li>
          <li>I worked as a software engineer intern at <strong>Google</strong> in Summer 2016, developing novel algorithms
              to improve maps and navigation data using large geolocation datasets (> 100Gb). </li>
          <li>In 2014, I was a visiting researcher for five months in <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu">Pr. Alexandre Bayen</a> supervision.</li>
          <li>In 2013 won a <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/fondation/prix-jean-louis-gerondeau-zodiac-aerospace"> â‚¬10K innovation prize</a> for a smart bicycle <strong>start-up</strong> project.</p>
