## The tools I use on daily basis:
* Tmux
* NeoVim
* Spacemacs
* zsh
* window manger: i3wm

## For R, Python, and Julia programming I use:
[Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) for R and
[vimcmdline](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline) for python and julia.
They are lightweight yet powerful IDE to write and run code inside neovim
environment.  

## For writing document and GTD I use:
[org-mode](https://www.orgmode.org) in
[spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) to manage my life. 

## For math modeling I use:
[Minizinc](https://github.com/MiniZinc) and [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) to model
optimization problem, and [COINOR-CBC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) as
default open-source solver, Cplex in commercial/academic setting.
