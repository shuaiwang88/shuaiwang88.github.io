      My current research interests are <strong>Large-Scale Optimization</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>,
      <strong>Data Analytics</strong> and applications to <strong>Retail, Higher Education,
          Alternative Data, Public Policy, and Insurance</strong>.
      My work mostly lies in <strong>Predictive</strong>  and <strong> Prescriptive</strong>  part of data science:

The research uses classification algorithms to find
matriculation and graduation rate by varying scholarships. Then the
optimization model was developed to optimize revenue under budget, fairness constraints.
This research has prompted the university wide scholarship redesign, see <a href="https://www.wright.edu/raider-connect/financial-aid/first-year-scholarships"> the APS calculator</a>. 


This project has resulted a 11% (2014), 13.9% (2015) increase in direct admit
students, which translates into a 5 to 10 million dollars of revenue increase
for WSU annually.

<strong>1. Promotion Planning Optimization</strong> 
        <p>
An optimization model was jointly developed with A.T.Kearney to optimize promotion planning and
assortment selection to benefit the overall revenue. System is
implemented in 2014 and saves about 5 percent of the total purchasing cost annually.
        <p>
          
<strong>2. Forecast and Optimization for clinic</strong> 
  <p> 
  The problem is to accurately forecast the number of patients by type to each clinic. Sophisticated forecast models that utilize inputs from time, weather, social
  media data like Google trend queries are used to predict the number of
  visits. These forecasts then serve as input to calculate the inventory necessary for
  each type of sickness, and a nurse scheduling system is created accordingly.
  <p>
 
<strong>3. Local Across-Store Inventory Transfer Optimization</strong> 
   <p> The problem is to ship medical drugs from stores with excess to stores with needs so as to: 1) reduce
  potential obsolesces in inventory; 2) better position drugs to meet customer
  demand; 3) to aggregate the shipment in such that transportation costs are
  reduced. The model is piloted in 121  stores and is expected
  to produce $30 to $50 million savings  as well as reduction in
  out-of-stock (OOS).
  <p>
<strong>4. Pharmacy Department Register Simulation</strong> 
   <p> Each store has a different volume in terms of patients visit and service time.The simulation
  model has been created to adjust the number of registers to be installed in
  each store, as a function of service time and customer volume.
    <p>
<strong>5. Order-picking Staff Daily Scheduling System Optimization</strong> 
     <p> The staff scheduling system is built to optimize the number of staff required to picking orders. It saves about than 20  to 30 % labor cost than the previous implementation. 
  <p>
  
<strong>6. Order-Picking Batching and Routing</strong>
   <p> Optimized picking sequence and TSP-styled routing are created based on individual store layout. 
    <p>
    
<strong>7. Time Series Anomaly Detection</strong>
   <p> Using different machine learning for stock price anomaly detection. Please see the dashboard <a href="https://shuaiwang.shinyapps.io/StockPriceAnomalyDetection/">Stock Price Anomaly Detection</a>
