\cventry{2011--2017}{Graduate Researcher/Teaching Assistant}{Wright State University}{Dayton, OH}{}{}

\textbf{Research Impact:} Delivered scholarship allocation models adopted institution-wide, enhancing student recruitment and financial planning. Supported academic instruction in analytics.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dissertation: Data mining techniques and mathematical models for the optimal scholarship
allocation problem for a state university}. The research uses classification algorithms to find matriculation
and graduation rate by varying scholarships. Then the optimization model was developed to optimize revenue
under budget, and fairness constraints. This research has prompted the university wide scholarship redesign,
the APS calculator, see Website. This project has resulted a 11\% (2014) and 13.9\% (2015) increase in direct
admit students, which translates into a 5 to 10 million dollars of revenue increase for WSU annually. 
 \item \textbf{Teaching:} Supported curriculum in Data Mining and Operations Research.
  \item \textbf{Dissertation Committee:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Xinhui Zhang (Supervisor): Senior Director of Data Science at Coupang; 3X INFORMS Franz Edelman Award Laureate.
